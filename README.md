# Welcome to Graph-RPI: Predicting RNA-protein interactions via graph autoencoder and self-supervised learning strategies
RNA-protein interactions (RPIs) are essential for many biological functions and are associated with various diseases. Traditional methods for detecting RPIs are labor-intensive and costly, necessitating efficient computational methods. We proposed a novel RPI prediction framework based on graph neural networks (GNNs) that addressed key limitations of existing methods, such as inadequate feature integration and negative samples construction. Compared with other state-of-the-art RPI prediction methods, our approach demonstrates greater robustness and stability in RPI prediction.

# Using Graph-RPI for RNA-protein interaction prediction

## Single pair prediction

To predict whether a given RNA-protein pair interacts, use the following command:

```bash
python Single_pair_prediction.py -i ./Single/Protein.fasta ./Single/RNA.fasta -o record.json
```

## Multiple pairs prediction
To predict interactions for multiple RNA-protein pairs, use the following command:

```bash
python Multiple_pairs_prediction.py \                                                       
    -p "./Multiple/interaction.txt" \
    -prot "./Multiple/Protein.txt" \
    -rna "./Multiple/RNA.txt" \
    -o "record.json"
```
